Udemy course: Advanced Solidity: Understanding and Optimizing Gas Costs

==============Section: Overview of gas cost==============

function selector is the first 4 bytes of the keccak256 hash of the function signature.

in a txn, the msg.data value takes up 4 gas for a zero value i.e 0x00
and takes up 16 gas for each byte of data. i.e 0x01 in the msg.data takes up 16 gas.

Deployed a simple contract with only single function.

function doNothing() external payable{} with optimization enabled to 1000 runs.

Now, a txn to the doNothing() took exactly 21138 gas.
Lets dive in, how we got that amount exactly.

First thing, As we know basic any txn on EVM, takes 21,000 gas.

Second is, as we have called the doNothing() function. which means the function selector is passed in the msg.data 
as we know that function selector is 4 bytes long and also from the yellow paper understood that, each byte takes up 16 gas.
Therefore, 64 gas. adds up to current total of 21,064
